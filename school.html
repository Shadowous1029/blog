			<h1>School</h1>
			School lunches are gross most of the time in elementary and middle schools, but we have to eat so our stomaches will be roaring.
			And on top of school lunches looking mad or gross, school lunches should look more appealing and have kids eat healthy, 
			have a full meal for some stundents.
